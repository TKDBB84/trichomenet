            <p>TRICHOMENET utilizes grid boxes generated with the heat map to estimate leaf area for leaf density calculations. Only boxes which have at least 1 trichome are included in this calculation.</p>
            <p>In low density cases, where boxes that are within the leaf edge outline, but have no trichomes, it may be necessary to add "empty boxes" to obtain proper density values. These can be easily counted by hand in the few instances they are necessary</p>
